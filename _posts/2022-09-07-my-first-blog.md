Hello everyone, this is my first blog post ever made. I don't know how to do that, so...

## What is Kochanowski

Kochanowski is a fun project that is somewhat different from normal programming languages: The syntax is based on the Polish language. Also to make it even harder you need to follow some rules:

* You need to begin a sentence with an upper letter and end it with a dot.
* Variables need to start from the upper case.
* You can't use symbols like `+`, `*` or `/`. You need to define it by words e.g. `2 plus 4`.

The syntax is just translated JavaScript, which also supports `import` and `export`. That means that you can make a functioning Express.js website, or even a discord bot using Kochanowski.

Example Kochanowski Express.js application

<!-- Idk why but "py" looks the best -->
```py
Załącz express z biblioteki "express".
Stałej App przypisz wartość express().
Stałej Port przypisz wartość 3000.

App z upchniętym get("/" oraz (Req oraz Res) => {
  Res z upchniętym  send("Express + Kochanowski").
}).

App z upchniętym  listen(Port oraz () => {
  Drukuj(`Przykładowa aplikacja słucha na porcie ${Port}`).
}).
```

The name Kochanowski comes from a Polish poet named "Jan Kochanowski"[^0], the only reason I know about his existence is school.

## Why did I make it

There are several reasons why I created a meme programming language. The main reason is to make fun of Matura Exams[^1], where you can only choose 4 programming languages[^2]:

* Python
* C++
* Java
* Pascal[^3]

I created this language fully because of memes. Now you can write **Polish** code, instead of English.
